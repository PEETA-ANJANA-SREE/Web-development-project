Web development involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It includes web design, programming, content creation, and database management. Developers use various tools and languages to ensure websites are functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing.

Web development is the process of building and managing websites and web applications. It includes front-end and back-end development, e-commerce, programming, content generation, database management, user experience (UX), responsive design, and web security. To create effective, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing websites, developers employ a variety of tools and languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js.

**1.To Do List**


This To-Do list code snippet provides a simple, interactive way for users to manage tasks. Implemented using HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality, it allows users to add, edit, and mark tasks as completed. The interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, supporting efficient task management across devices. We encourage contributions to enhance its features, improve usability, and integrate additional functionalities like task prioritization or due date reminders.

**2.Hidden Password**


This code snippet is for a simple password input field with a toggleable visibility feature. The HTML structure includes a password input element and an eye icon, which allows users to show or hide the password for easier entry. The associated CSS and JavaScript files ensure proper styling and functionality.

**3.Age calculator**


This age calculator code snippet allows users to calculate their age based on their date of birth. It utilizes HTML for the user interface, JavaScript for the calculation logic, and CSS for styling. Users input their birthdate, and the script computes their current age dynamically. This tool aims to provide a simple and interactive way for users to determine their age quickly. 

**4.QR Code**


This QR code generator code snippet enables users to generate QR codes dynamically. It utilizes HTML for the interface, JavaScript for QR code generation using a library like qrcode.js, and CSS for styling. Users can input text or a URL, and the script generates a QR code image that can be scanned by devices equipped with QR code readers. This tool aims to facilitate quick sharing of information through QR codes, enhancing convenience and accessibility.

**5.POP UP**


This pop-up (modal) code snippet provides a versatile way to display messages, notifications, or interactive content on web pages. Utilizing HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, it offers a responsive and user-friendly interface. Users can trigger the pop-up through various events like button clicks or page loads, enhancing interaction and user engagement

**6.Stop Watch**


This repository contains a simple stopwatch web application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch displays hours, minutes, and seconds, allowing users to start, stop, and reset the timer as needed. It includes functionality to handle incremental time updates using setInterval in JavaScript, ensuring accurate timekeeping. This project serves as a practical example of front-end web development, demonstrating basic DOM manipulation and event handling techniques.
